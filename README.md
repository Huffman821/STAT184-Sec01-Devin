# STAT184-HW-Template
 STAT184 Github Day 1 HW Template
This is my new repository. The goal of this repository is to compare baseball statistics. Lookind at WAR, offensive rating, and defensive rating. 
In this code, I loded in an HTML and cleanded it so that it is useable. I also added image files for the players. I created scatterplots to compare WAR, ORTG and DRTG. The inly issue I encountered was that the data wasn't considered numeric, so I made that change. 
This repository contains data on wins above replacement (WAR) in Major League Baseball (MLB), which is weighed against statistics including offensive/defensive rating, runs allowed, and earned runs averaged (ERA) to evaluate which players are more crucial to their teams' successes.
